<h1>Ongoing Research</h1>
<p class="subtitle">By <a href="index.html">Grégoire Lits</a> updated January 2023<p>
<p>Since the completion of my PhD in political sociology (2015) on the place of experts, expertise and citizen participation in decision-making processes related to the problem of radioactive waste management in Belgium, my research has focused on the evolution of the career of different social problems in public and media spaces as well as on the roles played by experts, scientists and different types of knowledge in these spaces.</p>
<p>I am especially  interested in the role that trust plays in public spaces and how trust in different types of actors (politicians, experts, journalists) evolves over time. </p>
<p>I have therefore been involved for the last ten years in various research projects on different social problems such as: radioactive waste management, the fight against poverty, the management of the ageing population, the fight against climate change and, more recently, the <strong>Covid-19 crisis</strong> and the <strong>fight against disinformation</strong>.</p>
<p>I have recently published several articles or research reports on the definition of the notion of <strong>infodemic linked to Covid-19</strong>, the notion of <strong>Moral Panics</strong> (with Céline Mavrot and Cédric Passard) or on the <strong>links between trust, anxiety, disinformation and conspiracy theories</strong>.</p>
